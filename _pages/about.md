I'm a first-year Ph.D. student from the Institute Of Computing Technology, Chinese Acadamy of Sciences (ICT, CAS). I am generally interested in cloud computing and operating system.

I am very fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof.Xiaobing Feng](http://www.ict.cas.cn/sourcedb_2018_ict_cas/cn/jssrck/200909/t20090917_2496613.html) of Institute of Computing Technology, CAS and [Prof.Chenxi Wang](https://wangchenxi7.github.io/home/) of Institute of Computing Technology, CAS.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in me or want to talk with me.
